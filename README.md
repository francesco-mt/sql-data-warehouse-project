# Data Warehouse Project

This repository contains a small-scale data warehouse project designed to demonstrate fundamental data engineering workflows  â€” from raw data ingestion to data modeling and transformation - and SQL knowledge.

The project includes:
- **Data ingestion** (from CSV sources)
- **Staging and transformation scripts**
- **Data warehouse schema setup**
- **ETL/ELT orchestration**
- **Documentation** to guide each phase

## Project Structure and Origin

> **Important Note:**  
> The overall **idea, structure, and task breakdown** for this project are based on the original work by [DataWithBaara](https://github.com/DataWithBaara).  
> I followed Baara's public educational material to build and implement this project from scratch using my own code, while adhering to the conceptual framework provided.

All scripts in this repository are written by me as a hands-on exercise to reinforce my learning and practical skills in data warehousing but originates from tasks delegated by Baara.
